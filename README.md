# Fluxion
Now You will crack WPA2 easily ......!!!!
Fluxion is the future of MITM WPA attacks
Fluxion is a security auditing and social-engineering research tool. It is a remake of linset by vk496 with (hopefully) less bugs and more functionality. The script attempts to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 key from a target access point by means of a social engineering (phishing) attack. It's compatible with the latest release of Kali (rolling). Fluxion's attacks' setup is mostly manual, but experimental auto-mode handles some of the attacks' setup parameters. Read the FAQ before requesting issues.

If you need quick help, fluxion is also avaible on gitter. You can talk with us on Gitter or on Discord.
